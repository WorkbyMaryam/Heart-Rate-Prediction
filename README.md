# Heart-Rate-Prediction

Heart disease remains a critical global health issue, with heart attacks being one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Timely prediction and diagnosis of heart attacks are essential for effective intervention and improved patient outcomes. This report delves into the utilization of machine learning techniques for predicting heart attacks by leveraging clinical parameters provided in the Heart Attack Prediction dataset. The dataset comprises 303 samples and 13 features, including age, sex, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure, along with a binary target variable indicating the likelihood of a heart attack. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we discovered significant correlations between certain features, like age and cholesterol levels, and the likelihood of a heart attack. Data preprocessing steps included encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Feature extraction was performed using methods such as SelectKBest, Variance Thresholding, Tree-based Feature Selection, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Lasso Regression, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Eight machine learning models were developed, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Network, with Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy at around 85%. Additionally, explainable AI techniques, specifically LIME and SHAP, were employed to elucidate the models' predictions, offering valuable insights into feature importance and enhancing model interpretability for healthcare professionals. This study underscores the potential of machine learning models in effectively predicting heart attacks, contributing to early intervention strategies and better patient care.
